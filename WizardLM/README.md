## News

At present, our core contributors are preparing the **65B** version and we expect to empower WizardLM with the ability to perform instruction evolution itself, aiming to evolve your specific data at a low cost.

- ðŸ”¥ Our WizardLM-13B-V1.0 model achieves the 1st-rank of the opensource models on the [AlpacaEval Leaderboard](https://tatsu-lab.github.io/alpaca_eval/).
- &#x1F4E3; Please refer to our Twitter account https://twitter.com/WizardLM_AI and HuggingFace Repo https://huggingface.co/WizardLM . We will use them to announce any new release at the 1st time. 
- ðŸ”¥ We released  **WizardLM-30B-V1.0** ([Demo_30B](https://4919f66f0be2b1f0.gradio.app), [Demo_30B_bak](https://243d23ffb61204d1.gradio.app)) and **WizardLM-13B-V1.0** ([Demo_13B](https://88149bd2f5b409bd.gradio.app)) trained with **250k** evolved instructions (from ShareGPT), and **WizardLM-7B-V1.0** ([Demo_7B](https://74ecfd89dccaaa08.gradio.app)) trained with **70k** evolved instructions (from Alpaca data). Please checkout the [Delta Weights](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244).

- &#x1F4E3; We are looking for highly motivated students to join us as interns to create more intelligent AI together. Please contact caxu@microsoft.com

<!-- Although on our **complexity-balanced test set**, **WizardLM-7B has more cases that are preferred by human labelers than ChatGPT** in the high-complexity instructions (difficulty level >= 8), it still lags behind ChatGPT on the entire test set, and we also consider WizardLM to still be in a **baby state**. This repository will **continue to improve WizardLM**, train on larger scales, add more training data, and innovate more advanced large-model training methods. -->


<b>Note for 30B and 13B model usage:</b>

To obtain results **identical to our demo**, please strictly follow the prompts and invocation methods provided in the **"src/infer_wizardlm13b.py"** to use our 13B model for inference. Unlike the 7B model, the 13B model adopts the prompt format from <b>Vicuna</b> and supports **multi-turn** conversation.

<b>For WizardLM-13B-V1.0, WizardLM-30B-V1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: hello, who are you? ASSISTANT: 
```

<b>For WizardLM-7B-V1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
"{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```

### GPT-4 automatic evaluation

We adopt the automatic evaluation framework based on GPT-4 proposed by FastChat to assess the performance of chatbot models. As shown in the following figure, WizardLM-30B achieved better results than Guanaco-65B.

</p>

### WizardLM-30B performance on different skills.

The following figure compares WizardLM-30B and ChatGPTâ€™s skill on Evol-Instruct testset. The result indicates that WizardLM-30B achieves 97.8% of ChatGPTâ€™s performance on average, with almost 100% (or more than) capacity on 18 skills, and more than 90% capacity on 24 skills.

## WizardLM Weights
We release [WizardLM] weights as delta weights to comply with the LLaMA model license.
You can add our delta to the original LLaMA weights to obtain the WizardLM weights. Instructions:
1. Get the original LLaMA weights in the huggingface format by following the instructions [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama).
2. Please download our delta model at the following [link](https://huggingface.co/victor123/WizardLM) 
3. Use the following scripts to get WizardLM weights by applying our delta:
```
python src/weight_diff_wizard.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>
```

## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune WizardLM using code from [WizardLM Training](https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM/tree/main/training).
We fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B|
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Batch size     | 64       | 384      |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 2e-5     |
| Epochs         | 3        | 3        |
| Max length     | 2048     | 2048     |
| Warmup step    | 2        | 50       |
| LR scheduler   | cosine   | cosine   |

To reproduce our fine-tuning of WizardLM, please follow the following steps:
1. According to the instructions of [Llama-X](https://github.com/AetherCortex/Llama-X), install the environment, download the training code, and deploy.
2. Replace the train.py with the train_freeform.py in our repo(src/train_freeform.py)
3. Execute the following training command:
```bash
deepspeed train_freeform.py \
    --model_name_or_path /path/to/llama-7B/hf \
    --data_path /path/to/alpaca_evol_instruct_70k.json \

```

## Distributed Fine-tuning
See [Distributed Fine-tuning](./doc/distributed_finetune.md)

## Inference

**NOTE:** The **WizardLM-13B-1.0** and **Wizard-7B** use different prompt at the beginning of the conversation!

We provide the decoding script for WizardLM, which reads a input file and generates corresponding responses for each sample, and finally consolidates them into an output file.

You can specify `base_model`, `input_data_path` and `output_data_path` in src\inference_wizardlm.py or src\infer_wizardlm13b.py to set the decoding model, path of input file and path of output file.




<b>For WizardLM-13B-1.0 </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: hello, who are you? ASSISTANT: 
```

The decoding command of 13B model:
```
python src/infer_wizardlm13b.py
```

<b>For WizardLM-7B </b>, the Prompt should be as following:

```
"{instruction}\n\n### Response:"
```

The decoding command of 7B model:
```
python src\inference_wizardlm.py
```


### Evaluation

To evaluate Wizard, we conduct human evaluation on the inputs from our human instruct evaluation set [`WizardLM_testset.jsonl`]. This evaluation set was collected by the authors and covers a diverse list of user-oriented instructions including difficult Coding Generation & Debugging, Math, Reasoning, Complex Formats, Academic Writing, Extensive Disciplines, and so on. We performed a blind pairwise comparison between Wizard and baselines. Specifically, we recruit 10 well-educated annotators to rank the models from 1 to 5 on relevance, knowledgeable, reasoning, calculation and accuracy. 

WizardLM achieved significantly better results than Alpaca and Vicuna-7b. 
<p align="center" width="60%">
<a ><img src="imgs/win.png" alt="WizardLM" style="width: 60%; min-width: 300px; display: block; margin: auto;"></a>
</p>

In the high-difficulty section of our test set (difficulty level >= 8), WizardLM even outperforms ChatGPT, with a win rate 7.9% larger than Chatgpt (42.9% vs. 35.0%). This indicates that our method can significantly improve the ability of large language models to handle complex instructions.
